what if i have an xgboost model locally in pickle format and i want to run on an array of features (not via udf or anything via snowflake, as i just need to manually run it locally)

To run an XGBoost model stored in a local pickle file on an array of features locally, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Solution
```python
import pickle
import numpy as np
import xgboost as xgb

# 1. Load the pickled XGBoost model
with open('model.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)  # Loads either XGBClassifier or Booster

# 2. Prepare your feature array (2D array: samples × features)
# Example: 3 samples with 4 features each
test_array = np.array([
    [1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8],
    [2.3, 4.5, 6.7, 8.9],
    [3.4, 5.6, 7.8, 9.0]
])

# 3. Check model type and make predictions
if isinstance(model, xgb.Booster):
    # For native XGBoost Booster
    dmatrix = xgb.DMatrix(test_array)
    predictions = model.predict(dmatrix)
else:
    # For scikit-learn API models (XGBClassifier/XGBRegressor)
    predictions = model.predict(test_array)

# 4. Output results
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

### Key Details
1. **Model Loading**:
   - Use `pickle.load()` to deserialize the model[1][2]
   - Works for both `XGBClassifier` (scikit-learn API) and `Booster` (native API)

2. **Input Format**:
   - Features must be a 2D NumPy array (`n_samples × n_features`)[3][2]
   - Feature order must match training data

3. **Prediction Differences**:
   - **Booster models** require conversion to `DMatrix`[3]
   - **Scikit-learn models** use raw NumPy arrays directly[2]

4. **Output**:
   - Regression: Returns continuous values
   - Classification: Returns class labels (use `predict_proba()` for probabilities)

### Example Output
For a classifier model:
```python
# To get class probabilities (if classifier)
probabilities = model.predict_proba(test_array)
print("Class probabilities:", probabilities)

# Output example:
# Predictions: [1 0 1]
# Class probabilities: [[0.2 0.8], [0.9 0.1], [0.3 0.7]]
```

### Important Notes
- **Feature Consistency**: Ensure feature count/order matches the model's training data[3][2]
- **Model Type**: Check `type(model)` if unsure of API:
  - `xgboost.sklearn.XGBClassifier`: Use `predict()`/`predict_proba()`
  - `xgboost.Booster`: Convert to `DMatrix` first
- **Dependencies**: Requires `xgboost`, `numpy`, and `pickle` installed

This approach avoids Snowflake/UDF dependencies and runs purely locally. The model remains unchanged after loading, and predictions execute in-memory for fast results[1][2].
